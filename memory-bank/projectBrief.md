# Project Brief: PR Firm Content Generation System

## Core Mission
Develop a sophisticated content generation system that creates platform-optimized, brand-consistent content while systematically eliminating AI fingerprints that reduce authenticity. The system must address the critical gap in marketing where teams spend excessive time manually rewriting content and struggle with AI-generated content being flagged as inauthentic.

## Key Objectives
1. Create a 17-node workflow pipeline using PocketFlow framework
2. Implement research-backed detection and elimination of the "7 Deadly Sins" of AI writing
3. Develop advanced brand voice processing and pattern learning capabilities
4. Build a comprehensive version control and analytics system
5. Create a user-friendly interface with preset management capabilities

## Success Metrics
- 300% increase in engagement due to authentic content
- 3 hours saved per content generation cycle
- 100% elimination of AI fingerprints through comprehensive pattern detection
- 95%+ accuracy in pattern detection (currently achieving 80% with enhancement in progress)
- 40-60% reduction in false positives for brand-specific expressions
- Enhanced testing framework with comprehensive coverage of all pattern types
- Autonomous development methodology using Six Thinking Hats framework for systematic debugging

## Current Achievements
- **Enhanced Pattern Detection**: Achieved 80% test pass rate (4/5 tests passing) for Deadly Sins detector
- **Em Dash Detection**: Perfect functionality with accurate counting of multiple occurrences
- **Antithesis Detection**: Enhanced pattern matching with expanded phrase recognition
- **Multi-Pattern Detection**: Successfully identifies combined patterns in single text
- **Testing Framework**: Comprehensive test suite with 5 targeted test cases including negative tests
- **Debugging Methodology**: Systematic approach using Six Thinking Hats for autonomous development
- **Pattern Counting**: Accurate counting functionality for multiple pattern occurrences
- **Expanded Phrase Matching**: Enhanced capabilities for better pattern recognition

## Constraints
- No external service integrations
- Only connects to LLMs through OpenRouter utility functions
- Must detect and remove all "7 Deadly Sins" patterns with zero tolerance
- Maximum 5 revision cycles for style compliance before manual review required
- Output must be formatted markdown with copy-to-clipboard functionality

## Technical Architecture
- PocketFlow Node graph with specialized processing nodes
- Advanced shared store state management with nested dictionaries
- Batch processing for parallel platform generation
- Fault-tolerant retry mechanisms with intelligent fallback
- Pattern learning feedback loops
- Multi-order validation scanning (structural → semantic → stylistic)

## Market Positioning
Position the system as the industry standard for authentic content generation, solving the critical pain point of time-consuming manual rewriting and AI-generated content being flagged as inauthentic. The system must demonstrate measurable improvements in engagement and time savings while maintaining brand consistency across all platforms.
