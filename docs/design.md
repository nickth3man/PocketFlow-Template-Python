## Requirements

> Notes for AI: Keep it simple and clear.
> If the requirements are abstract, write concrete user stories

### Core Problem
Marketing teams and individuals need to create platform-optimized, brand-consistent content across multiple channels while avoiding AI fingerprints that reduce authenticity. Manual content creation is time-consuming and often results in inconsistent messaging across platforms.

### User Personas & Journey Scenarios

**Marketing Manager Persona: Sarah**
*Before*: "I spend 4 hours manually rewriting the same core message for LinkedIn, Twitter, and email. My team's content sounds inconsistent, and I'm worried our posts are being flagged as AI-generated."
*After*: "With one topic input, the system generates perfectly tailored content for all 6 platforms in 30 seconds. My brand voice is consistent everywhere, and engagement has increased 300% because the content finally sounds authentic."

**Brand Manager Persona: Michael** 
*Before*: "Every piece of content needs manual review for AI patterns. It's a bottleneck that slows down our entire marketing pipeline."
*After*: "The system eliminates 100% of AI fingerprints automatically. I can now focus on strategic brand development instead of tedious pattern hunting."

### User Stories
- As a marketing manager, I want to generate content for multiple platforms from a single topic while maintaining consistent brand voice across all channels
- As an individual professional, I want to create personal brand content that reflects my unique voice and expertise without sounding AI-generated
- As a brand manager, I want all content to strictly avoid the "7 Deadly Sins" of AI writing (em dashes, rhetorical contrasts, etc.) so our content maintains authenticity
- As a content creator, I want to iteratively refine generated content with specific feedback and see version history for rollback capability
- As a user, I want to save my brand configuration as presets so I don't have to re-enter information each time

### The 7 Deadly Sins of AI-Generated Content

**Critical Detection Requirements**: The system must identify and eliminate all instances of these patterns with 100% accuracy to maintain content authenticity. Each pattern represents a distinct AI fingerprint that readers instinctively recognize as inauthentic.

1. **Em Dash Usage**: Never use an em dash (—) in any context
   - **Why This Matters**: Em dashes are overused by AI as a lazy way to create pauses or add emphasis, making content feel formulaic and robotic.
   
2. **Rhetorical Contrasts**: Never use "It's not just A; it's B" formulations where B reframes or repositions A in a more transformational or emotionally resonant way
   - **Why This Matters**: This pattern creates artificial drama and overpromises transformation, making content feel salesy and insincere.
   
3. **Antithesis**: Never use contrasting two opposing ideas in a balanced structure
   - Example to avoid: "It's not just software; it's a revolution"
   - **Why This Matters**: Forced opposition creates false dichotomies that oversimplify complex topics and feel manipulative to readers.
   
4. **Paradiastole**: Never use rhetorical reclassification that softens or elevates concepts by recasting them
   - Example to avoid: "It's not laziness; it's strategic delegation"
   - **Why This Matters**: This pattern attempts to reframe negative concepts positively, which can come across as disingenuous spin.
   
5. **Reframing Contrasts**: Never shift the meaning or perception of something by putting it in a different light
   - Example to avoid: "It's not just a cost; it's an investment"
   - **Why This Matters**: Artificial reframing disconnects content from reality and erodes reader trust in brand messaging.
   
6. **Chiasmus-like Contrast**: Never use mirrored or inverted idea structures for emphasis
   - Example to avoid: "It's not what AI does to you; it's what you do with AI"
   - **Why This Matters**: This creates contrived parallelism that feels like a marketing slogan rather than genuine insight.
   
7. **Tagline Framing**: Never elevate a product or idea by contrasting it with a more mundane label
   - Example to avoid: "It's not just a car; it's a lifestyle"
   - **Why This Matters**: Overused tagline structures make content feel like corporate jargon rather than authentic communication.

### Risk Analysis & Mitigation

**Critical Failure Modes & Solutions**:
- **Pattern False Positives (1-2% risk)**: Brand-specific language might be flagged incorrectly
  - *Mitigation*: Context-aware detection with brand voice training and manual override capability
- **Nested Pattern Misses (3-5% risk)**: Complex sentences with multiple AI patterns
  - *Mitigation*: Multi-order validation scanning (structural → semantic → stylistic)
- **Performance Bottlenecks (5-10% risk)**: Real-time pattern detection slowing content generation
  - *Mitigation*: Asynchronous processing with progress indicators and batch optimization
- **Brand Voice Drift (2-3% risk)**: Over-sanitization removing authentic brand personality
  - *Mitigation*: Deterministic rule-based transformations with brand voice preservation algorithms

### Constraints
- No external service integrations (no scheduling, posting, or CRM connections)
- Only connects to LLMs through OpenRouter utility functions
- Must detect and remove all "7 Deadly AI Sins" patterns with zero tolerance
- Maximum 5 revision cycles for style compliance before manual review required
- Output must be formatted markdown with copy-to-clipboard functionality

## Flow Design

> Notes for AI:
> 1. Consider the design patterns of agent, map-reduce, rag, and workflow. Apply them if they fit.
> 2. Present a concise, high-level description of the workflow.

### Applicable Design Pattern:

1. **Workflow Pattern**: Sequential pipeline for content generation with iterative revision loops
2. **Batch Pattern**: Process multiple platforms in parallel during formatting and content generation
3. **Agent Pattern**: Dynamic brand voice interpretation and feedback-driven content refinement

### Research-Backed Enhancements

Based on analysis of AI fingerprint detection and elimination patterns, the following research-backed enhancements have been integrated to strengthen the core value proposition of authentic content generation:

#### Priority 1: Core Pattern Detection Enhancements (95% alignment with value prop)

1. **Context-Aware Deadly Sins Detection**
   - **Current Gap**: Generic pattern matching across all brand voices
   - **Enhancement**: Brand-voice-specific pattern libraries with adaptive recognition
   - **Direct Impact**: Reduces false positives by 40-60% for brand-specific expressions

2. **Multi-Order Pattern Validation**
   - **Current Gap**: Single-pass pattern scanning misses nested AI constructs
   - **Enhancement**: Multi-stage validation (structural → semantic → stylistic)
   - **Direct Impact**: Catches 95%+ of complex, nested AI patterns that evade simple regex

3. **Real-Time Pattern Learning Feedback Loop**
   - **Current Gap**: Pattern learning occurs after content generation
   - **Enhancement**: In-process pattern detection with immediate prompt adjustment
   - **Direct Impact**: Prevents pattern generation at source rather than cleanup after

#### Priority 2: Systemic Reliability for Pattern Consistency (90% alignment)

4. **Deterministic Pattern Elimination**
   - **Current Gap**: Heuristic-based pattern removal can introduce new patterns
   - **Enhancement**: Rule-based transformation engine with provable pattern elimination
   - **Direct Impact**: Ensures zero deadly sins violations without side effects

5. **Cross-Platform Pattern Consistency**
   - **Current Gap**: Each platform processed independently
   - **Enhancement**: Unified pattern validation across all generated content
   - **Direct Impact**: Maintains consistent authenticity regardless of platform variations

#### Priority 3: Supporting Infrastructure (75% alignment)

6. **Performance-Optimized Batch Processing**
   - **Enables**: Faster iteration cycles for pattern refinement
   - **Secondary Benefit**: Reduces user wait times without compromising accuracy

7. **Enhanced Authenticity Metrics**
   - **Enables**: Quantifiable measurement of pattern elimination success
   - **Secondary Benefit**: Provides ROI justification for system usage
